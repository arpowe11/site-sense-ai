### Installing the requirements.txt file:
To install the requirements, make sure you have a .venv already created for you project ```python -m venv .venv``` 
Once you created you .venv you can activate it by running ```source .venv/bin/activate```.
Then you can install the requirements by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. 
If that does not work due to dependency issues you can run this command ```pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps```
